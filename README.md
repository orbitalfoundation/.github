# Orbital Foundation

Orbital is an open source project to develop publically accessible tools that anybody can use to make digital twins, simulations and models. The goal is to make it easier for anybody to better explore and understand the kinds of complex issues we face today, and to help with collective decision making by better aligning stakeholders. There is a strong emphasis on accessibility by non technical people.
